# High Octane
## Site Introduction
High Octane is fun game site for car lovers to test their knowledge on 3 different car stats. The website has been made as I love cars personally and wanted to join my 2 passions. The users of the website will be able to easily navigate the website as I have used pointers and enlarging buttons to prompt the user to click to start the game.

## Planning the website/game
### Site purpose
 - Have a fun easy game for car lovers to play to test their knowledge of many different cars.
 - Be able to track previous high scores and compete to beat the previous high score.
 - End the game when the user gets the answer wrong, display their final score and give the option to play again or return to the main menu to select another game
### Easy to navigate
 - I made sure to encorporate a simple easy to follow design to the page so that the user can easily start to play the game of their choice, return to the main menu and open/close the how to play menu.
 - Part of making the site easy to navigate in this project was using the :hover CSS to allow for the users on laptops/desktops to easily navigate the site with pointer cursor, colour flip when hovering and the transitions to enlarge the buttons to prompt the user to click.
 - I have used flex to make the site fully responsive so that is best uses the space across all screen sizes, using flex makes the code easy to navigate as there are less media queries required.
 - The colour choice is very simple, I started of using a 4 color palette I found on Canva but as I went on to tidy up the site I decided that using images and simple black overlays with white text created the look that I wanted for the site. The colours were kept simple for the end site as there is already alot going on with the images so the text being bold makes every peice of text clear to read
### Target Audience
 - My target audience for this site is primarily car lovers and enthusiasts who want to test their knowledge.
 - People who want a simple fun game to play in their spare time.
 - People who want to test their knowledge of cars.
 - People who want to learn more about cars.
 - Groups of friends who want to have a bit of friendly competition with a fun easy to use game to see who can get the highest score
### How will I acheive all of this?
- I have added meta tags to the head of my page so that people looking for a higher or lower game, car game, fun game to play can find my site and play.
- I have added clear easy to read instructions for how to plan the games so that if users are unsure on how to play they can simply open the 'How to play?' menu and read the instructions, close the menu using the big 'X' in the corner and select the game they want to play.
- I have added clear text to show the user that when they click each game button they know what stat they will be guessing if it is higher or lower for.
- On the game screen there is a 'Score' overlay in the corner to show the user their current score, this updates as they play.
- I have added a play again and main menu button to the final score screen once the user inputs an incorrect answer which clearly allows the user to navigate around the site.
- All buttons on the site have media queries setup so that when a mouse hovers the buttons enlarge and colours flip to clearly show what the user is hovering over.
### Tools/Input from others
 - I plan to share the website with my friends who are also car enthusiasts to get their opinions and find any issues with the site for me to rectify.
 - I will speak with other students at Code Institute to gather opinions on things that I may be able to change/add and also things that I have missed. I believe it is always good to have another opinion or set of eyes to look over your work as there is always bits you miss yourself.
  - Tools I used for this project:
   - HTML and CSS Validators
   - Lighthouse in the dev tools
   - Chatgpt, this was only used to pic lots of super cars names and find out all of the information about them that I needed to save myself time having to google 50+ cars stats. I will also use this to spell check my work.
   - All of the images are sourced from free websites on google or from google images.
   - Favicon has been used to add the favicon car silhoutte to my page.
   - Fontawesome has been used to add the social media icon links to my pages.
   - I have used JSHint to help with my javascript code when possible.
